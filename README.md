# Federated Learning

This is a simple implementation of **federated learning (FL)** with the **noising before model aggregation FL (NbAFL)** strategy. The bare FL model (without NbAFL) is actually the reproduction of the paper [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) and the NbAFL algorithm was proposed in [Federated Learning with Differential Privacy: Algorithms and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00222)
